		<article>
		<p style="color:white">The first place on my list is <a href="https://mezzalunanyc.com/"> <b>Mezzaluna Ristorante NYC</b> </a>! Mezzaluna has been my favorite restaurant of all time beginning in my early childhood. First, their service is fantastic and the atmosphere is just as good. Their passion fruit iced tea is the drink they are known for and they provide free refills which is nice. I recommend the Margarita Pizza, Penne Ala Bisansio, and the Pollanca salad — you will not be disappointed!

		<p style="color:white;"> My next favorite is <a href="https://www.baritaliamadison.com/"> <b>Bar Italia</b></a>. Bar Italia is an upper east side Italian restaurant with delicious Italian food and a great selection of wine. The staff is extremely kind and knowledgeable when asking about suggestions of what to get for your meal. Being on the upper east side, it is a little on the pricier side but the atmosphere is great and it is a great meal for lunch or dinner.I suggest the truffle pasta or tuna taretare!

		<p style="color:rebeccapurple"> Another great spot is <a href="https://www.lilfrankies.com/"> <b>Lil' Frankies</b> </a>. Lil Frankie’s is located in downtown NYC and is perfect for a date night! The ambiance is truly fantastic a nd the food is fresh and delicious. The drinks are great and the overall prices are cheaper than most NYC italian food. The atmosphere makes you feel like you are almost in Italy. I recommend making a reservation in advance as their usually is a long wait and it gets very crowded around dinner time. I recommend the spaghetti limonè and the fire roasted eggplant. All of the pizzas are also great!
