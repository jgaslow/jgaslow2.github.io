		<h2>A Little About Me</h2>
		<p style="color:rebeccapurple;">Hi everyone! My name is Jillian Gaslow and I am a sophomore at the <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/"> University of Wisconsin-Madison</a> I am currently majoring in Consumer Science and Marketplace Studies in the School of Human Ecology. Additionally, I just declared certificates in entrepreneurship and digital studies. I Grew up in New York City and went to Columbia Prep, which is a small school on the upper west side. At UW-Madison, I was able to get involved in many clubs such as the Student Retail Association, Challah For Hunger, The FIT Magazine, and the Souvenir Magazine. Additionally, I decided to join Greek life on campus which helped make a large school feel a lot smaller. In Greek life, I decided to join my sorority’s executive board as Apparel Chair as it clearly aligns with my future career goals. After I graduate, it is my hope to work in the retail industry, specifically in social media marketing or digital management. I am huge foodie and I hope you all enjoy reading about my favorite restaurants!</p>
